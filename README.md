# mu4e-overview.el - Show overview of maildir #

This Emacs package lets you see a hierarchy of maildirs in a separate buffer:

```
mymail@gmail.com
 [Gmail]
  .Trash [0/25]
  .Starred [0/0]
  .Spam [0/3]
  .Sent Mail [0/4]
  .Important [0/21]
  .Drafts [0/0]
  .All Mail [0/56]
 Trash [0/0]
 Inbox [2/45]
```

## Usage ##

`M-x mu4e-overview` displays a buffer with a list of all maildirs.  The root
maildir can be set via the variable `mu4e-maildir`.

The number of unread and total number of emails is displayed next to each
maildir in this format: `[UNREAD-COUNT/TOTAL-COUNT]`.  If UNREAD-COUNT is not
zero, that maildir is highlighted.

Use n and p keys to go to next/previous maildir (or alternatively,
tab/backtab).  Use [ and ] keys to go to previous/next *unread* maildir.

When you click on a maildir or type RET when point is on it, mu4e headers view
is displayed, which shows messages only in that maildir.  Type `C-u RET` to
show only unread messages.

## API ##

The package also provides the function `mu4e-overview-gather` which returns the
folder hierarchy and asynchronously counts the number of total and unread
counts for each folder.  This can be used to build a custom view of the folder
hierarchy.  See it's documentation for details.

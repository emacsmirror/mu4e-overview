	Version 0.2.0

	- Adapt to mu4e v1.3.7

	- New variable mu4e-overview-parallel-processes can be used to
	control the number of spawned processes during update.  Raising
	that limit can speedup the update, but it can also lead to
	resource exhaustion when are many maildirs to update. (on some
	OSes)

	- Fix progress reporter during update: it showed "done" before all
	maildirs were updated.
